# COS221_Assignment5

## Quick Guide to Repository + Projects :round_pushpin:
(A suggestion for organizing our workflow, definitely up for discussion :smiley:)
- The repository is where we store all files related to our assignment.
- A repository is like a snapshot of a local directory stored on a remote server allowing team members to work on the same files simultanously.
- For a quick introduction to understanding and using GitHub: [Fireship Video](https://youtu.be/HkdAHXoRtos?si=ax6mAmmd5BQ5ZsaP)
- We use Projects to manage tasks (commonly referred to as **issues** in Git terms), including what needs to be done to mark an issue as completed, assigning issues to members etc.
- [What we are aiming for](https://youtu.be/yFQ-p6wMS_Y?si=Xkz19jPfAGdglEEm)
- For each assignment deadline there is a **milestone**, milestones an be viewed by either going to the _Pull requests_ or the _Issues_ tab and clicking on the Milestone button
- Issues are assigned to milestones which allows us to track our progress towards meeting a specific deadline. Issues can be assigned to multiple milestones.
- The **README** is written in the [markdown format](https://youtu.be/HUBNt18RFbo?si=gQAA_U-E8poBMxpN), most importantly: [emojis](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) can be used throughout :smirk:
- A Discord Bot will send notifications of any hapennings on the repo to the `github-updates` text channel on our Discord server
- git showcase
